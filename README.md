Since Rainbow Six Siege lacks two sensitivity sliders for the different zoom levels I wrote a python script to somewhat get around that. The script calculates an XFactorAiming based on your FOV and desired vertical match distance that will very accurately line up with two corresponding ADS sensitivity values. This is so that you can somewhat quickly change your sensitivity in-game based on if you're using an ACOG or not in the current round.

XFactorAiming value is set in Documents\\My Games\\Rainbow Six - Siege\\\<random shit\>\\GameSettings.ini under \[INPUT\]
